## Latest Project: AI-Driven Book Management System

I recently developed an **AI-Driven Book Management System** using Python, FastAPI, LangChain, and AWS infrastructure. This project showcases my expertise in integrating AI models, cloud deployment, and asynchronous programming. Key features include:

- **Database Management:** Utilized AWS RDS PostgreSQL for efficient storage and retrieval of books and reviews.
- **AI-Generated Summaries:** Integrated the Llama3 model, deployed on AWS SageMaker, for generating summaries of books based on their content.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Implemented two key scenarios:
  - **Scenario 1:** Recommending books based on user preferences and written reviews using `pgvector` embeddings.
  - **Scenario 2:** Providing tailored book suggestions based solely on user preferences for those without reviews.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Enhanced performance by implementing asynchronous operations for database interactions and AI model predictions using `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` and `asyncpg`.
- **Embedding Generation and Similarity Search:** Utilized the HuggingFace model `distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens` via a serverless API for generating embeddings, and performed similarity searches against book content.
- **Content Extraction:** Employed LangChain loaders for extracting book content from files.
- **API Development and Security:** Developed a secure RESTful API using FastAPI with JWT token protection, providing comprehensive documentation via Swagger.
- **Dockerization:** Containerized the application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability

This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy advanced AI systems, ensuring secure and efficient operations.
